Scenario: Add two numbers
	Given the first number is 50
	And the second number is 70
	When the two numbers are added
	Then the result should be 120

Scenario: Add two other numbers
	Given the first number is 50
	And the second number is 60
	When the two numbers are added
	Then the result should be 110

Scenario: Subtract a small number from a bigger number
	Given the first number is 100
	And the second number is 75
	When the two numbers are subtracted
	Then the result should be 25

Scenario: Subtract a bigger number from a smaller number
	Given the first number is 10
	And the second number is 75
	When the two numbers are subtracted
	Then the result should be -65

Scenario: Multiply two positive numbers
	Given the first number is 100
	And the second number is 75
	When the two numbers are multiplied
	Then the result should be 7500

 
Scenario: Heber assignment 1
	Given the first number is 100
	When operation + is done to the number 50
	And operation + is done to the number 80
	Then the result should be 230

	
Scenario: Heber assignment 2
	Given the first number is 100
	When operation + is done to the number 50
	And operation + is done to the number 80
	And operation + is done to the number 80
	Then the result should be 310

Scenario: Heber assingment 3
	Given the first number is 100
	When operation + is done to the number 50
	And operation + is done to the number 80
	And operation + is done to the number 80
	And operation / is done to the number 10
	Then the result should be 31

 
Scenario: Heber assignment 4
	Given the first number is 100
	When operation / is done to the number 50
	And operation - is done to the number 2
	And operation + is done to the number 10
	And operation % is done to the number 3
	Then the result should be 1

Scenario: test to see if i can divide by zero and catch my exception!
	Given the first number is 10
	When operation / is done to the number 0
	Then the result should be null

Scenario: try a modulus by zero
	Given the first number is 9
	When operation * is done to the number 3
	And operation % is done to the number 2
	And operation % is done to the number 0
	Then the result should be null

Scenario: : multiple in a row
	Given the first number is -200
	When operation % is done to the number 2
	And operation / is done to the number 0
	And operation % is done to the number 0
	And operation + is done to the number 50
	Then the result should be null
